# WorldElements
Writing assistant focused on organization and quick access to plot and story elements.

## Preface
I started this project to organize my ideas in a way that works with my ADHD and memory issues to eventually work on a web comic. I wasn't a fan of how other software and online writing assistants worked and decided to create my own. This is my first project working with python, javascript, and SQL other than minor tweaks to scripts or tools created by coworkers. At this point I am more interested in making things work rather than being efficient or conforming to standard practices.

## Usage components
World Elements currently has the following menu bar items:

- Worlds
- Projects
- Books
- Compose
- Plotlines
- Elements
- Relationships

## Worlds
Worlds contain elements that can be referenced between multiple projects and books. They are basically the universe of your story.

## Projects
Projects contain one or more books that are part of a series. 

## Books
Books are parts, chapters, and sections that compose a complete story, or part of a series of complete stories.

## Compose
Compose breaks books into front, middle, and back matter and is where actual story composition takes place.

### Front Matter
front matter things

### Middle
The actual story stuff

#### Parts
Parts are acts/modules that group chapters together. They are like acts in a play/novel, or modulessections in a textbook.

#### Chapters
Chapters are groupings of sections. They are like chapters in a novel, or submodules in a textbook.

#### Sections
Sections are paragraphs or groups of paragraphs.

### Back matter
Back matter stuff

## Elements
Organization of elements. Elements can be characters, things, places, etc.
